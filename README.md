  This android app is written for Kotlin. It combines several well-known and beloved mathematical tasks.
  You can register on it using your email and password.
When the app is launched, two buttons will appear. In case you are not registered yet, you need to click Sign Up and register. 
If you are already registered, you need to click Sign In, after which you will be taken to the main page of the application. 

  Here you will see seven buttons. Clicking on each of them will open the corresponding Activity. Each Activity has a simple instruction in the form of TextView,
and each of them is designed to solve a specific math problem: 

printing prime numbers in the specified range;
Solving a quadratic equation;

Converting a decimal number to binary; 
Calculate the sum of integers for an input number from 1 to this number, calculate the sum of the digits of this number, and find the divisors of this number. 

You can even write a test: a question and four possible answers will appear; You need to click on the approximate answer that you think is correct and if it is
correct it will turn green, otherwise it will turn red.
Using the Next Question button you will be able to move to the next question and when you write the last question the program will count your result.
I think you will like it. Good luck!
